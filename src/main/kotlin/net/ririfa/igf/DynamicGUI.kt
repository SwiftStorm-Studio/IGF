/**
 * A generic dynamic GUI framework for creating inventories with an adaptive state-based design.
 *
 * @param T The type of the state enumeration that defines the various states the GUI can have.
 * @param player The player for whom this GUI is being created.
 * @see InventoryGUI
 * @since 1.1.0
 *
 * The `DynamicGUI` class extends `InventoryGUI` to provide enhanced functionality for creating GUIs
 * that dynamically change based on specific predefined states. Each state is defined by an enum
 * parameter, allowing the GUI to map buttons and functionality specific to each state.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Manages state transitions and updates the GUI accordingly.
 * - Allows the creation of mappings between states and button configurations.
 * - Supports dynamic updates of inventory content based on the current state.

	 * Steps performed in this method:
	 * - Retrieves the list of buttons for the current state from `buttonMappings`.
	 * - Clears the inventory to prepare for the new buttons.
	 * - Applies the background to the inventory, if defined.
	 * - Adds the buttons to the inventory and sets each button in its respective slot.
	 * - Updates the player's inventory to reflect these changes immediately.
	 *
	 * It uses:
	 * - `buttonMappings`: A map linking states to button configurations.
	 * - `applyBackground()`: Applies a visual background to the inventory.
	 * - `setItems(List<Button>)`: Updates the GUI items list with the current buttons.
	 * - `inventory.setItem(slot, item)`: Places individual buttons into their designated slots.
	 * - `player.updateInventory()`: Ensures the player's view is updated with any changes made to the GUI.
	 *
	 * If the current state does not have mapped buttons, the inventory will remain empty
	 * aside from the background, if one is applied.
	 *
	 * This function assumes that `currentState` has been set and that `buttonMappings`
	 * contains a valid mapping for the state.
